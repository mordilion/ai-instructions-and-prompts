# Security Policy

## Supported versions

Security updates are applied to the **latest code on the `main` branch**.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please **do not** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, use one of the following:

- **Preferred**: Report privately via **GitHub Security Advisories** (Repository → *Security* → *Report a vulnerability*)
- If Security Advisories are not available: contact the maintainer privately via the contact details on their GitHub
  profile

Include as much of the following as possible:

- A clear description of the vulnerability and potential impact
- Steps to reproduce (proof-of-concept if applicable)
- Affected files/paths and any relevant configuration
- Suggested mitigation (if you have one)

## What to expect

- We will acknowledge receipt as soon as practical.
- We will work with you to understand and reproduce the issue.
- We will coordinate disclosure timing once a fix or mitigation is available.

Thanks for helping keep this project and its downstream users safe.
