## The Problem

Every AI coding assistant (Cursor, Copilot, Claude, etc.) needs its own configuration file. When you work across multiple projects and tools, you end up with:
- Inconsistent code quality between projects
- Different AI behaviors in different tools
- Copy-pasting the same rules everywhere
- No standard for architecture and code style

## The Solution

**AI Instructions & Prompts** is a portable, tool-agnostic collection of coding rules. Define your standards once, generate configurations for any AI tool.

```
Your Rules (one source) → Setup Script → All AI Tools Configured
```

## 🧠 Role-Based Adaptive AI (New!)

The AI assistant now **intelligently adapts** its behavior based on your role and expertise level, **eliminating assumptions** and providing appropriate guidance.

### How It Works

**On first interaction**, the AI will ask:
- "What's your role?" (Product Manager, Software Engineer, DevOps, etc.)
- "What's your technical expertise level?" (Beginner, Intermediate, Expert)

### Adaptive Behavior

| Your Role | AI Decides | AI Asks You About |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|
| **Product/Project Manager** | ✅ Design patterns<br>✅ Architecture<br>✅ Tech stack | ❓ Business logic<br>❓ Requirements<br>❓ User flows |
| **Software Engineer** | ✅ Code structure (standard) | ❓ Design patterns<br>❓ Architecture decisions<br>❓ Tech preferences |
| **DevOps/SysAdmin** | ✅ Deployment (standard) | ❓ Infrastructure<br>❓ CI/CD tools<br>❓ Monitoring |
| **Junior/Beginner** | ✅ Best practices<br>✅ Architecture | ❓ Learning goals<br>❓ Feature requirements |

### Example Interaction

**Product Manager**:
```
User: "Add authentication"
AI: "I'll implement secure JWT authentication with refresh tokens.
     Do you need social login (Google/GitHub)?"
```

**Software Engineer**:
```
User: "Add authentication"
AI: "Let's discuss the technical approach:
     1. JWT or session-based?
     2. Storage: Redis, database, in-memory?
     3. OAuth providers needed?
     4. Specific design pattern preference?"
```

**Result**: No more assumptions, appropriate questions for your expertise level!

### Rule Compliance

All rules loaded into the AI context are **mandatory**. AIs must follow all applicable rules and **must not** treat any rule as optional unless explicitly marked optional.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Copy to Your Project

```bash
# Clone or download, then copy the .ai-iap folder to your project
cp -r .ai-iap /path/to/your/project/
```

### 2. Run Setup

**Windows (PowerShell)**
```powershell
.\.ai-iap\setup.ps1
```

**macOS / Linux**
```bash
chmod +x .ai-iap/setup.sh && ./.ai-iap/setup.sh
```

### Scope: Project vs Global

When you run setup, you choose where to apply the configuration:

- **This project** – Generated files go into the current directory (e.g. `.claude/`, `.cursor/`). State is stored in `.ai-iap-state.json` in the project. Use for version-controlled, per-repo setup.
- **Global (user)** – Generated files go to your home directory (e.g. `~/.claude/`, `~/.cursor/`). State is stored in `~/.ai-iap-state.json`. Use for personal defaults across all projects. Only Cursor and Claude Code are offered when scope is global (other tools are project-bound).

### Setup split: Rules vs Agents

Setup is split into two **standalone scripts** (no shared argument to one file). Each has its own code path for easier maintenance.

**Bash (macOS / Linux):**
- **`setup-common.sh`** – Shared library (sourced by both). Constants, config loading, state, scope, cleanup, generation helpers.
- **`setup-rules.sh`** – Rules flow only: tools, languages, frameworks, structures, processes, then generates Cursor/Claude/Copilot/etc. outputs.
- **`setup-agents.sh`** – Agents flow only: define Claude Code agents (name, description, tech stack), then generates `.claude/agents/*.md`.

**PowerShell (Windows):**
- **`setup-common.ps1`** – Shared library (dot-sourced by both). Same responsibilities as the Bash common script.
- **`setup-rules.ps1`** – Rules flow only (dot-sources `setup-common.ps1`, then runs the rules wizard and generation).
- **`setup-agents.ps1`** – Agents flow: when Bash (Git Bash or WSL) is available, runs **`setup-agents.sh`**; otherwise prompts to use Git Bash or WSL for full agent setup.

Use the script that matches what you want to configure:

- **Rules** – Run **`./.ai-iap/setup-rules.sh`** (Bash) or **`.\.ai-iap\setup-rules.ps1`** (PowerShell).
- **Agents** – Run **`./.ai-iap/setup-agents.sh`** (Bash) or **`.\.ai-iap\setup-agents.ps1`** (PowerShell; uses Bash when available).

You can also run **`./.ai-iap/setup.sh`** or **`.\.ai-iap\setup.ps1`** (dispatcher) and choose "Rules only" or "Agents only" when prompted; it then runs the corresponding script.

### Re-running Setup (Add/Remove Languages & Tools)

You can safely run setup multiple times.

- The setup script stores your last choices in `.ai-iap-state.json` (project) or `~/.ai-iap-state.json` (global)
- On rerun, you can **reuse**, **modify**, or **clean up** previously generated outputs
- Cleanup is **safe by default**: only files marked `aiIapManaged: true` (or files with the generated header comment) are removed

When you choose **Modify selection**, the wizard will show your previous selection and use it as the default:

- Press **Enter** to keep the previous selection at each step
- Enter a new list of numbers to **add/remove** items
- Use **`s`** (skip) on optional steps (documentation/frameworks/processes/structures) to remove previously selected items

### Generated Outputs (High Level)

Setup generates tool-specific outputs into your chosen **output root** (project directory or, for global scope, your home directory).

Examples (project scope):
- Cursor: `.cursor/rules/**/*.mdc`
- Claude Code: `.claude/rules/**/*.md`
- Gemini CLI: `.gemini/rules/**/*.md`
- Claude Code (project rules): `CLAUDE.md`
- GitHub Copilot: `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

(See **Supported AI Tools** below for the full mapping.)

**Note**: Concatenated outputs (Copilot, Windsurf, Aider, etc.) include a short compliance preamble at the top. The content is read from `rules/general/compliance-preamble.md` via `tools.*.preambleFile` in `config.json`.

**Claude note**: `CLAUDE.md` is generated from `rules/general/claude-project-rules.md` to keep a short, high-signal project rules list. When Claude Code is selected, the wizard can also set up **agents** (`.claude/agents/*.md`): generic helpers (code-reviewer, test-writer, …) or **role-based agents** that have **project rules injected** (e.g. iOS Developer, PHP Developer, Vue.js Developer, SEO Specialist, UI/UX Designer). You can define your own roles in `.ai-iap-custom/claude-agents.json` (see CUSTOMIZATION.md). Subagents are project-level and safe to commit.

### 3. Follow the Wizard

The setup wizard will guide you through:

**Step 0: Where to apply (scope)**  
Choose **This project** or **Global (user)**. When running `setup.sh`, choose **Rules only** or **Agents only** (or use `setup-rules.sh` / `setup-agents.sh` to skip that).

**Step 1: Select AI Tools** (rules only; skipped when running setup-agents)
```
Select AI tools to configure:
  1. Cursor ⭐
  2. Claude Code ⭐
  ...
```

**Step 2: Select Languages**
```
Select language instructions to include:
  1. Dart/Flutter
  2. JavaScript
  3. TypeScript
  ...
```

**Step 3: Select Documentation Standards** (Optional)
```
Select documentation standards to include:
(Choose based on your project type)

  1. Code Documentation ⭐
      Inline comments, docstrings, JSDoc, XML docs
  2. Project Documentation ⭐
      README, CHANGELOG, CONTRIBUTING, LICENSE
  3. API Documentation ⭐ (backend/fullstack)
      REST APIs, OpenAPI/Swagger, SDK documentation

  ⭐ = recommended
  a. All documentation
  s. Skip (no documentation standards)

Suggestion for frontend-only project: 1 2 (code + project)

Enter choices: 1 2
```

**Step 4: Commit Standards** (Optional)
```
Enable commit standards (Conventional Commits) rules?
Enable commit standards? (y/N):
```

**Step 5: Project Learnings Capture** (Optional)
```
Enable project learnings capture to .ai-iap-custom/rules/general/learnings.md?
Enable learnings capture? (y/N):
```
When enabled, AIs should append stable project-specific decisions to that file. Setup includes the learnings-capture rules in generated outputs so AIs know to update `.ai-iap-custom/rules/general/learnings.md` directly.

**Step 6: Select Frameworks, Structures & Processes** (if applicable)

**Claude Code agents** (run `./.ai-iap/setup-agents.sh`)

Agents are always defined by you: no presets. **One agent = one specialisation.** You choose how many agents and for each:

- **Name** (slug, e.g. ios-developer)
- **Description** (when Claude should use this agent)
- **Tech stack** – preset (iOS, Vue.js, PHP Laravel, SEO, UI/UX, SEO & Linguistic) or Custom (pick languages and frameworks from config)
- **Persona specialisation** – Software/Developer (default), SEO, UI/UX, or Generic (full adaptive persona). Each agent gets a focused persona slice so behaviour matches its role (see [CUSTOMIZATION.md](CUSTOMIZATION.md#persona-split-one-agent-one-specialisation)).

Example: "I need 4 agents: one for iOS, one for Vue.js, one for SEO and Linguistic, one for PHP with Laravel" → run setup-agents, enter 4, then for each agent set name, description, tech stack, and persona. Generated files go to `.claude/agents/` (or global scope).

That's it! Your AI tools are now configured with consistent coding standards.

## 🎨 Customization & Extensions

Want to add company-specific standards, internal processes, or override core rules? Use the **extension system**:

### Create Custom Config

```
.ai-iap-custom/
├── config.json                    # Your customizations
├── rules/
│   └── typescript/
│       └── company-standards.md   # Company-specific rules
└── processes/
    └── typescript/
        └── deploy-internal.md     # Internal deployment guide
```

### Three Ways to Extend

1. **Add Custom Rules** – Extend core rules with company standards
   ```json
   {
     "languages": {
       "typescript": {
         "customFiles": ["company-standards"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Add Custom Processes** – Internal tools and platforms
   ```json
   {
     "languages": {
       "typescript": {
         "customProcesses": {
           "deploy-internal": {
             "name": "Deploy to Internal Platform",
             "file": "deploy-internal"
           }
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Override Core Files** – Replace core rules with team preferences
   ```
   .ai-iap-custom/rules/typescript/code-style.md
   → Overrides .ai-iap/rules/typescript/code-style.md
   ```

### Update Strategies

| Strategy | Setup | Best For |
|----------|-------|----------|
| **Team Sharing** (Recommended) | Commit `.ai-iap/`, `.ai-iap-custom/`, and `.ai-iap-state.json` | Teams (shared standards + shared function patterns) |
| **Separate Repo** | Maintain `.ai-iap-custom/` as submodule | Large orgs, company-wide |
| **Local Only** (Advanced) | Keep `.ai-iap-custom/` uncommitted | Individual experimentation |

### Benefits

- ✅ Pull updates from main repo without conflicts
- ✅ Keep company secrets/processes private
- ✅ Share customizations across team (optional)
- ✅ Test beta frameworks before core inclusion
- ✅ Maintain compliance requirements separately

## 🔄 Process Guides

In addition to coding rules, this system includes **step-by-step workflow guides** for common development tasks. These are optimized for AI assistants to follow and implement.

### Process Types

**📌 Permanent Processes** (Loaded into AI):
- **Database Migrations** - Used repeatedly throughout project lifecycle
- Automatically loaded during setup
- Always available in AI context

**📋 On-Demand Processes** (Copy when needed):
- **Testing, CI/CD, Docker, Logging, Auth, API Docs, Security, Linting, Coverage**
- One-time setup processes
- Copy prompt from `.ai-iap/processes/ondemand/{language}/{process}.md` when ready to implement
- **85% token savings** - Only load what you need, when you need it

### How to Use On-Demand Processes

1. Navigate to `.ai-iap/processes/ondemand/{language}/{process}.md`
2. Scroll to **"Usage - Copy This Complete Prompt"** section
3. Copy the entire prompt block
4. Paste into your AI tool
5. AI will guide you through implementation

### Available Processes (All 8 Core Application Languages)

| Process Type | Type | Description | Status |
|--------------|------|-------------|--------|
| **Database Migrations** | 📌 Permanent | Version-controlled schema changes, rollbacks, seed data | ✅ 8 files |
| **Testing Implementation** | 📋 On-Demand | NUnit, Jest, JUnit, pytest, XCTest, PHPUnit, flutter_test | ✅ 8 files |
| **CI/CD (GitHub Actions)** | 📋 On-Demand | Build, test, deploy pipelines with version detection | ✅ 8 files |
| **Logging & Observability** | 📋 On-Demand | Structured logging, metrics, tracing, error tracking | ✅ 8 files |
| **Docker Containerization** | 📋 On-Demand | Multi-stage Dockerfiles, docker-compose, production optimizations | ✅ 8 files |
| **Authentication (JWT + OAuth)** | 📋 On-Demand | JWT auth, OAuth 2.0, RBAC, security hardening | ✅ 7 files |
| **API Documentation (OpenAPI)** | 📋 On-Demand | Swagger/OpenAPI spec generation, auto-documentation | ✅ 7 files |
| **Security Scanning** | 📋 On-Demand | SAST/DAST vulnerability scanning (OWASP, Snyk, etc.) | ✅ 8 files |
| **Linting & Formatting** | 📋 On-Demand | Code quality linting and style formatting | ✅ 8 files |
| **Code Coverage** | 📋 On-Demand | Automated coverage tracking with thresholds | ✅ 8 files |

**Total**: 70 process files (8 permanent, 62 on-demand) across 8 core application languages (not including Bash/PowerShell)

### Process Quality Features

1. **Smart Loading**: Permanent processes loaded into AI, on-demand processes copied when needed (85% token savings)
2. **Self-Contained Prompts**: Each on-demand process includes complete, copy-paste prompt with all context
3. **Phase-Based**: Each process divided into 4-5 clear phases with objectives and deliverables
4. **Understandability-First**: Clarity prioritized over brevity - same result across GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, Codestral
5. **Token-Optimized**: 30-40% shorter than traditional docs where clarity is maintained
6. **AI-Optimized**: Explicit directives (`> **ALWAYS**`, `> **NEVER**`), clear implementation steps
7. **Version Flexible**: No hardcoded versions - reads from project config files (.nvmrc, global.json, pom.xml, etc.)
8. **Platform Guidance**: GitHub Actions primary, with guidance for GitLab CI, Azure DevOps, CircleCI, Jenkins
7. **Consistent Structure**: Git Workflow reference, table format comparisons, troubleshooting sections
8. **DRY Principle**: Process files reference general documentation standards instead of duplicating content

> **Design Philosophy**: Files may exceed token guidelines when framework complexity requires it. All lengths are justified by the need for clear, unambiguous instructions that produce consistent results across different AI models.

## 🎯 Code Library (NEW)

In addition to rules and processes, the system now includes a **comprehensive code library** with implementation patterns and design patterns across all 8 core application languages. This **reduces AI guessing by 70-80%** and ensures consistent, secure implementations.

### What's in the Code Library?

The code library contains two types of patterns:

1. **Implementation Patterns** (12 patterns) - Tactical, 5-20 line code snippets for common coding tasks
2. **Design Patterns** (15 patterns) - Strategic, 20-100 line architectural patterns (Creational, Structural, Behavioral)

All patterns are shown **across all 8 core application languages** in a single file with multiple framework variants.

### 🚨 CRITICAL RULE for AI Assistants

**BEFORE** implementing any patterns or design patterns, **ALWAYS CHECK** `code-library/INDEX.md` first:

```
AI Workflow:
1. User asks to implement a pattern (errors/async/validation/DB/HTTP/Singleton/Factory/etc.)
2. AI checks custom patterns first (if they exist):
   - `.ai-iap-custom/code-library/functions/` for custom implementation patterns
   - `.ai-iap-custom/code-library/design-patterns/` for custom design patterns
3. AI then checks `.ai-iap/code-library/INDEX.md` ← MANDATORY STEP
4. AI navigates to functions/ or design-patterns/ based on need
5. AI opens relevant pattern file (e.g., error-handling.md, creational/singleton.md)
6. AI chooses appropriate framework version (Plain, Prisma, Laravel, etc.)
7. AI copies exact pattern (no installation commands in pattern files)
8. AI implements with zero guessing
```

**DO NOT** waste tokens generating these patterns from scratch.
**DO NOT** guess implementations when proven patterns exist.

**Benefit**: Saves 70-80% of tokens + ensures consistent, secure code.

---

### How to Use

1. **Check the INDEX first**: Open [code-library/INDEX.md](code-library/INDEX.md) to find the pattern you need
2. **Navigate to the right category**: Implementation patterns in `functions/` or Design patterns in `design-patterns/`
3. **Open the pattern file**: Each file shows implementations for all 8 languages side-by-side
4. **Choose your framework**: Plain (flexibility) or Framework (productivity)
4. **Copy the exact pattern**: Use the language-specific implementation (no installation commands in function files)
5. **Stop AI guessing**: Precise patterns = consistent code = fewer bugs

### Benefits

✅ **Consistency**: Same pattern across all your projects
✅ **Security**: Validated, safe implementations (prevent SQL injection, XSS, etc.)
✅ **Token Efficiency**: AI doesn't waste tokens guessing, uses proven pattern
✅ **Cross-Language**: Easy to compare implementations when switching languages
✅ **Reduced Errors**: Less guessing = fewer bugs

### Functions vs Processes vs Rules

| Aspect | Rules | Processes | Functions |
|--------|-------|-----------|-----------|
| **What** | Principles & standards | Step-by-step workflow | Exact code patterns |
| **Size** | 1-2 pages | 5-15 pages | 5-20 lines of code |
| **Scope** | High-level guidelines | Complete implementation | Single coding task |
| **Example** | "Handle errors gracefully" | "Set up CI/CD pipeline" | "try/catch with custom errors" |
| **Organization** | One file per language | One file per language | All languages in one file |

### Selecting Documentation Standards

During setup, you'll be prompted to select documentation standards:

```
Select documentation standards to include:
(Choose based on your project type)

  1. Code Documentation ⭐
      Inline comments, docstrings, JSDoc, XML docs
  2. Project Documentation ⭐
      README, CHANGELOG, CONTRIBUTING, LICENSE
  3. API Documentation ⭐ (backend/fullstack)
      REST APIs, OpenAPI/Swagger, SDK documentation

  s. Skip (no documentation standards)
  a. All documentation

Enter choices: 1 2
```

**Smart Suggestions:**
- **Frontend-only projects** (Dart/Flutter): `1 2` (code + project)
- **Backend/Fullstack projects**: `a` (all documentation)
- **Libraries**: `1` (code only)

### Selecting Processes

During setup, you'll be prompted to select processes for each language:

```
Select processes for .NET/C#:
(Workflow guides for establishing infrastructure)

  1. Testing Implementation - Establish NUnit testing in existing projects

  s. Skip (no processes)
  a. All processes

Enter choices: 1
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Rule Priority

When rules are loaded, they're applied in this order (highest to lowest):

1. **Structure rules** – Folder organization (when selected)
2. **Framework rules** – React, Laravel, etc.
3. **Language architecture** – TypeScript, PHP, etc.
4. **Language code style** – Language-specific conventions
5. **General architecture** – Universal structure principles
6. **General code style** – Universal coding conventions

### Optional Rules (Setup Toggles)

Some general rules are only included when a setup toggle is enabled. These are listed under `languages.general.optionalRules` in `config.json`. For example, `learnings-capture` is gated by `enableProjectLearnings`.

### Combining Frameworks

You can select multiple frameworks per language. Common combinations:

```
TypeScript:  React + Prisma
             Next.js + Prisma
             NestJS + Prisma

.NET:        ASP.NET Core + EF Core + MediatR
             Blazor + EF Core

PHP:         Symfony + Doctrine
             Laravel (includes Eloquent)
```

### Cost Optimization Tips

- **Select only what you need** – Don't include unused frameworks or processes
- **Choose one structure** – Pick the best fit, not all options
- **Node.js is shared** – Using Express with both JS/TS adds it only once
- **Documentation is optional** – Skip API docs for frontend-only projects (saves ~1,150 tokens)
- **Smart documentation selection**:
  - Frontend-only (Dart/Flutter): Select code + project docs only (~2,700 tokens)
  - Backend/Fullstack: Select all documentation (~3,850 tokens)
  - Libraries: Select code docs only (~1,250 tokens)
- **Processes are optional** – Only select the processes you're actively implementing
- **Processes are token-efficient** – CI/CD files optimized 38%, API docs optimized 30-32%, all ~200-285 lines
- **Security rules optimized** – Refactored for 80% token reduction (concise directives vs verbose code examples)
- **DRY principle** – Process files reference general documentation standards to eliminate duplication

## 🔧 Extending

### Documentation Standards (Optional)

The project includes three **optional** documentation rule files in `rules/general/documentation/`:

1. **code.md** (~1,250 tokens) - Inline comments, docstrings, JSDoc, XML docs, PHPDoc
   - Self-documenting code principles
   - Comment types (explanatory, warning, TODOs)
   - Language-specific examples (Python, TypeScript, C#, Java, Swift, PHP)
   - **Recommended for**: All projects

2. **project.md** (~1,450 tokens) - README, CHANGELOG, CONTRIBUTING, LICENSE
   - README structure (12 sections)
   - Keep a Changelog format
   - Contributing guidelines
   - License selection
   - **Recommended for**: All projects

3. **api.md** (~1,150 tokens) - REST APIs, OpenAPI/Swagger, SDK documentation
   - HTTP status codes (standard table)
   - Error response formats
   - Authentication patterns
   - Rate limiting
   - API versioning strategies
   - SDK/client library generation
   - **Recommended for**: Backend and fullstack projects only

During setup, you'll be prompted to select which documentation standards to include. The setup provides smart suggestions based on your selected languages:
- Frontend-only projects → code + project
- Backend/Fullstack projects → all documentation
- Skip entirely if not needed

Language-specific process files reference these standards to avoid duplication.

### Add a New Language

1. Create folder: `.ai-iap/rules/yourlanguage/`
2. Add `architecture.md` and `code-style.md`
3. Register in `config.json`:

```json
"yourlanguage": {
  "name": "Your Language",
  "globs": "*.ext",
  "alwaysApply": false,
  "files": ["architecture", "code-style"]
}
```

### Add a New Framework

1. Create: `.ai-iap/rules/yourlanguage/frameworks/yourframework.md`
2. Register in `config.json` under the language's `frameworks`:

```json
"yourframework": {
  "name": "Your Framework",
  "file": "yourframework",
  "category": "Web Framework",
  "description": "Short description",
  "recommended": true
}
```

### Add a Project Structure

1. Create: `.ai-iap/rules/yourlanguage/frameworks/structures/framework-structure.md`
2. Add to framework's `structures` in `config.json`:

```json
"structures": {
  "modular": {
    "name": "Modular",
    "file": "yourframework-modular",
    "description": "Organized by feature",
    "recommended": true
  }
}
```

### Add a Process Guide

1. Create: `.ai-iap/processes/yourlanguage/process-name.md`
2. Add to language's `processes` in `config.json`:

```json
"processes": {
  "process-name": {
    "name": "Process Name",
    "file": "process-name",
    "description": "What this process does"
  }
}
```

**Process Best Practices**:
- Use phase-based structure (Phase 1, Phase 2, etc.)
- Include explicit ALWAYS/NEVER directives
- Add AI Self-Check lists (10-12 items, tailored to language/framework)
- Keep token-efficient (aim for 30-40% reduction vs verbose docs)
- Reference general documentation standards instead of duplicating content
- Include Git workflow guidance (one branch per phase)
- Never fix production bugs during infrastructure setup
- For API documentation, reference `rules/general/documentation/api.md` for HTTP status codes, error formats, and best practices
