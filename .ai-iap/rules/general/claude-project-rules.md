# Project Rules (Claude)

Use this file for the **few** project-specific rules that must not be missed.

## Hard Rules (violations cause bugs)
- (Add 10–15 short, non-negotiable rules)
- (Focus on project-specific constraints and known failure modes)

## Style Preferences
- (Add preferences that differ from AI defaults)
- (Keep to 5–10 items)

## Environment Notes (Optional)
- (Add only if it changes implementation behavior)
