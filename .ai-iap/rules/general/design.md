# UI / Design & Component Reuse

> **Scope**: Apply these rules when implementing or changing any UI (web, mobile, desktop), UI logic, or user-facing flows. Always active for frontends and UI-heavy backends.

## Core Principles

> **ALWAYS** optimize for:
> - **Reusability**: build components once, reuse everywhere
> - **Consistency**: same patterns, same naming, same UI behavior
> - **Accessibility**: keyboard, semantics, contrast, focus states
> - **Maintainability**: small components with clear responsibilities

> **NEVER**:
> - Duplicate UI patterns across multiple screens when a reusable component fits
> - Hardcode design tokens (colors/spacing/typography) if your project has a theme/design system

---

## Component Design (Reusability First)

> **ALWAYS**:
> - Prefer **composition** over inheritance (small pieces that compose well)
> - Extract a reusable component when you see **repetition** (UI + behavior) across 2+ places
> - Keep components **single-purpose** and easy to test
> - Prefer **presentational + container** separation when it helps (UI vs data/side-effects)
> - Make components configurable via **props/parameters**, not forks/copies

> **NEVER**:
> - Create “mega-components” that handle multiple unrelated use cases
> - Bake routing, global state, or network calls into basic UI atoms (Button, Input, Card, etc.)

### Component API Guidelines

> **ALWAYS**:
> - Use clear, stable names (`PrimaryButton` is worse than `Button` with `variant="primary"`)
> - Prefer **variants** (`variant`, `size`, `tone`, `intent`) over multiple near-identical components
> - Prefer **slots/children** for flexibility over many boolean flags
> - Provide sane defaults; keep required inputs minimal
> - Expose callbacks/events for side effects; keep side effects outside reusable UI components

> **NEVER**:
> - Add “boolean explosion” props (`isBlue`, `isBig`, `isRounded`, …)
> - Use ambiguous props (`type`, `mode`) when a more specific name exists

## UX Behavior (Don’t Forget the States)

For every user-facing component/flow, handle all of these states:

> **ALWAYS** implement:
> - **Loading**: skeleton/spinner + disabled actions
> - **Empty**: explain what’s missing and how to proceed
> - **Error**: actionable message + retry if possible
> - **Success**: confirmation (toast/banner) for important actions

> **ALWAYS**:
> - Disable buttons while submitting to prevent double-submit
> - Keep destructive actions behind confirmation when irreversible
> - Prefer optimistic UX only when you can safely rollback

---

## Visual Consistency (Tokens & Layout)

> **ALWAYS**:
> - Use spacing/typography/color from a **central token source** (theme variables) if available
> - Keep spacing consistent (e.g., 4/8/12/16/24/32 scale)
> - Align to a grid; avoid ad-hoc pixel tweaking
> - Prefer reusable layout components (Stack, Grid, Container) over repeated CSS

> **NEVER**:
> - Hardcode “magic numbers” repeatedly (extract a token or use the design scale)
> - Mix multiple inconsistent UI patterns for the same intent (e.g., 3 different button styles)

---

## Accessibility (A11y) Requirements

> **ALWAYS**:
> - Ensure keyboard navigation works end-to-end
> - Provide visible focus styles (do not remove outlines without replacement)
> - Use correct semantics (buttons for actions, links for navigation)
> - Provide accessible names for icons-only controls
> - Ensure sufficient color contrast for text and interactive elements

> **NEVER** rely on:
> - Color alone to convey meaning (add text, icons, or patterns)

---

## Responsive & Internationalization Safety

> **ALWAYS**:
> - Design for multiple screen sizes; avoid fixed widths unless necessary
> - Assume text can grow (i18n): avoid truncation by default; wrap when possible
> - Avoid layout shifts; reserve space for async content

## AI Self-Check (UI / Design)

- [ ] Did I extract repeated UI into reusable components?
- [ ] Is the component API small, clear, and variant-based?
- [ ] Are loading/empty/error/success states handled?
- [ ] Are design tokens used instead of hardcoded values (when available)?
- [ ] Is accessibility addressed (keyboard, focus, semantics, contrast)?
- [ ] Is the UI responsive and i18n-safe (text expansion)?
