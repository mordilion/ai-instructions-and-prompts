# Compliance Standards (General)

> **Scope**: Apply when working on regulated, privacy-sensitive, or audited systems. If your project has no compliance requirements, treat this as “nice-to-have” and defer to `security.md` and project-specific policies.

## Data Classification & Handling

> **ALWAYS**:
> - Treat **PII/PHI/PCI/secrets** as sensitive by default
> - Minimize collection: only store what is required for the feature (data minimization)
> - Document where sensitive data is stored, processed, and transmitted
> - Enforce least-privilege access to data (RBAC/ABAC)

> **NEVER**:
> - Log secrets, tokens, passwords, or raw sensitive payloads
> - Copy production sensitive data into dev environments without explicit approval and sanitization

---

## GDPR / Privacy (PII)

> **ALWAYS**:
> - Define the **lawful basis** and purpose for processing PII (document at least at a high level)
> - Implement **right-to-delete** and **right-to-access/export** flows if required
> - Default to **pseudonymization** and minimize exposure in logs/analytics
> - Ensure data is retained **no longer than necessary** (align retention with policy)

> **NEVER**:
> - Use PII for secondary purposes without explicit approval/policy basis
> - Store PII in places with unclear ownership (ad-hoc spreadsheets, untracked buckets)

---

## Auditing & Evidence

> **ALWAYS**:
> - Log security-relevant events (auth failures, privilege changes, admin actions, data exports)
> - Include request correlation identifiers where applicable (trace IDs)
> - Ensure logs are tamper-resistant and retained according to policy
> - Keep an auditable change history for configuration affecting security/compliance

---

## SOC 2 / ISO 27001 Style Controls (Change Management)

> **ALWAYS**:
> - Require code review (and approvals when needed) for security/compliance-impacting changes
> - Ensure CI checks run and are recorded (tests, SAST/SCA, linting if used)
> - Track release provenance (what version/commit is deployed, when, by whom)
> - Maintain an incident trail: detection → triage → remediation → follow-up actions

---

## Retention & Deletion

> **ALWAYS**:
> - Define retention periods for sensitive data and logs
> - Implement deletion workflows when required (user deletion requests, legal requirements)
> - Prefer soft-delete only if policy allows; ensure eventual hard-delete when required

---

## Access Control & Separation of Duties

> **ALWAYS**:
> - Separate duties for high-risk actions (deployments, production data access, privileged config changes)
> - Use just-in-time access / break-glass processes for production access when possible
> - Restrict admin interfaces and require stronger auth for privileged operations

---

## HIPAA / PCI (If Applicable)

> **ALWAYS**:
> - Follow the applicable standard’s requirements for data handling, auditability, and access controls
> - Avoid introducing scope creep (keep PHI/PCI out of systems unless explicitly required)
> - Ensure encryption in transit and at rest for in-scope data and backups

> **NEVER**:
> - Store full payment card data unless explicitly required and approved (PCI scope explosion)

---

## Secure SDLC Expectations

> **ALWAYS**:
> - Run dependency and security scanning as part of CI (SCA/SAST, container scanning if applicable)
> - Treat high/critical findings as release blockers unless explicitly accepted and documented
> - Ensure code reviews are required for changes in security/compliance-critical areas

---

## Must-Have Documentation & Evidence (When Regulated/Audited)

> **ALWAYS**:
> - Keep a clear record of security/compliance-relevant decisions (threat model notes, risk acceptance, approvals)
> - Document data flows for sensitive data (where it enters/leaves, storage locations, processors)
> - Document operational runbooks for incident response and data deletion/export flows
> - Ensure releases are reproducible and traceable (versioning + changelog/release notes where required)

## AI Self-Check (Compliance)

- [ ] Did I avoid logging sensitive data and redact where necessary?
- [ ] Are audit logs present for privileged and data-export operations?
- [ ] Is retention/deletion behavior defined and implemented where required?
- [ ] Are permissions least-privilege and consistent across the system?
- [ ] Are compliance-relevant CI checks in place (or documented as TODO with owner)?
- [ ] If GDPR/PII applies: do we support deletion/export and data minimization?
- [ ] If SOC2/ISO applies: is change management and release provenance covered?
- [ ] If HIPAA/PCI applies: is scope minimized and data protected end-to-end?
