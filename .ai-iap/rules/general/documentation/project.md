## CHANGELOG Standards

> **Reference**: [Keep a Changelog v1.1.0](https://keepachangelog.com/)

| **Deprecated** | Soon-to-be-removed | "Deprecate v1 endpoints" |
| **Removed** | Removed features | "Remove Node 12 support" |
| **Fixed** | Bug fixes | "Fix memory leak in cache" |
| **Security** | Security patches | "Patch XSS vulnerability" |

> **ALWAYS**: Use present tense ("Add" not "Added")  
> **ALWAYS**: Link to issues/PRs when relevant  
> **NEVER**: Include internal refactoring unless user-facing

4. **Testing** (how to run tests)
5. **Pull Request Process** (review, merge criteria)

**Sections**: Code of Conduct, Development Setup, Workflow (fork/branch/commit/PR), Testing, Review Process

**PRs require:

## LICENSE File

> **ALWAYS**: Include LICENSE file in repository root  
> **ALWAYS**: Use SPDX identifier in README and package files

## Badge Standards

> **ALWAYS**: Place badges at top of README  
> **ALWAYS**: Keep badges relevant and up-to-date

### Recommended Badges

```markdown
![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/user/repo/ci.yml)
![Coverage](https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/user/repo)
![Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/package-name)
![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/user/repo)
```

### Badge Categories (Priority Order)

1. **Build/CI Status** (critical)
2. **Test Coverage** (quality indicator)
3. **Version** (latest release)
4. **License** (legal compliance)
5. **Downloads** (popularity - optional)

## Documentation Anti-Patterns

| ❌ Bad Practice | ✅ Better Approach |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Outdated installation steps | Test docs regularly, automate if possible |
| Screenshots without alt text | Add descriptive alt text |
| No version in docs | Include "Last updated" or version |
| Broken links | Use link checker in CI |
| Wall of text | Break into sections with headers |
| Missing prerequisites | List all required tools/versions |
