# JSON Security

> **Scope**: JSON security guidance (manifests, tool configs, app config).  
> **Extends**: General security rules

## 1. Secrets
- **NEVER**: Store secrets or tokens in JSON committed to git.
- **Prefer**: Reference secret stores or environment variables.

## 2. Package/dependency risk (where applicable)
- **ALWAYS**: Be cautious with executable hooks/scripts defined in JSON configs (e.g., build scripts).
- **Prefer**: Least privilege and explicit allowlists for tooling that executes commands.

Follow the general security rules; the rules above are additive.
