# Code Style & Philosophy (General)

> **Scope**: These are baseline rules for ALL languages. Language-specific rules (when present) take precedence.

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

> **ALWAYS**: Apply SOLID principles
> **ALWAYS**: English only (code, comments, commits)
> **ALWAYS**: Self-documenting code (comments explain WHY)
> **ALWAYS**: Refactor methods >50 lines
> **ALWAYS**: Avoid else (use early returns)
> **ALWAYS**: Extract variable for repeated method calls / expensive expressions
>
> **NEVER**: Implement features "for later" (YAGNI)
> **NEVER**: Abstract before 3 repetitions (DRY)
> **NEVER**: Use else/else if (use early returns/switch)
> **NEVER**: Magic numbers (use named constants)
> **NEVER**: Reformat unrelated code
> **NEVER**: Call the same method twice in one expression (extract variable)

## 1. Core Principles
- **SOLID**: Apply strictly
- **DRY**: Abstract after 3 repetitions (Rule of Three)
- **YAGNI**: NEVER implement features "for later"
- **KISS**: Simplest working solution wins

## 2. Structure
- **Order**: Constants → Fields → Constructor → Public Methods → Private Methods.
- **Grouping**: By feature, NOT alphabetically. Getter/Setter adjacent.
- **Method Size**: Target 20-30 lines. MUST refactor if >50 lines. Split when description requires "and".

## 3. Naming
- **Language**: English only (code, comments, commits).
- **Clarity**: Full words (`index` not `i`), except loop counters (`i`, `j`, `k` allowed).
- **Intent**: Name describes WHAT, not HOW.

## 4. Control Flow

> **ALWAYS**: Prefer early returns over else. Keep happy path at lowest indentation.

```typescript
// ❌ BAD: Nested else chains
function getDiscount(user: User): number {
  if (user.isPremium) {
    if (user.years > 5) {
      return 0.3;
    } else {
      return 0.15;
    }
  } else {
    return 0;
  }
}

// ✅ GOOD: Guard clauses, flat logic
function getDiscount(user: User): number {
  if (!user.isPremium) return 0;
  if (user.years > 5) return 0.3;
  return 0.15;
}
```

- **Multiple branches**: Use `switch` / pattern matching instead of `else if` chains.
- **Template languages**: If markup requires `else` (Razor `@if/else`, Svelte `{:else}`), prefer extracted components or enum-driven rendering.

## 5. Reduce Method Calls (Extract Variable)

> **Pattern**: *Extract Variable* (Martin Fowler) — also known as *Introduce Explaining Variable*.
>
> **ALWAYS**: Store the result of a method call in a local variable when you need the value more than once in the same scope.
> **ALWAYS**: Name the variable to reveal intent (the variable name is free documentation).
> **NEVER**: Invoke the same getter, computation, or I/O-triggering method repeatedly within one expression or block.

### Why

- **Performance**: Avoids redundant work (getters may be expensive, involve DB/HTTP, or allocate).
- **Consistency**: Guarantees the same value is used across the expression (no race conditions on mutable state).
- **Readability**: The variable name explains the meaning of the expression.
- **Debuggability**: A breakpoint can inspect the single computed value.

### Example

```typescript
// ❌ BAD: Method called twice, condition and result duplicated
const displayName =
  customer.getCompanyName() !== null && customer.getCompanyName() !== ''
    ? customer.getCompanyName()
    : customer.getContactPerson();

// ✅ GOOD: Called once, intent is clear
const companyName = customer.getCompanyName();
const displayName =
  companyName !== null && companyName !== '' ? companyName : customer.getContactPerson();
```

### When to extract

| Situation | Extract? |
|---|---|
| Method called 2+ times in the same expression | ✅ Always |
| Method called 2+ times in the same block with same arguments | ✅ Always |
| Expensive computation / I/O / DB access | ✅ Always |
| Result used to build an intermediate explanation | ✅ Usually (explaining variable) |
| Trivial property access used once | ❌ No |
| Simple local calculation used once | ❌ No |

> **Language shortcuts**: Many languages offer null-coalescing / Elvis operators (`??`, `?:`) that collapse these patterns into a single line. See the language-specific code-style rules for concrete syntax.

## 6. Best Practices
- **Comments**: Explain WHY, never WHAT. Code MUST be self-documenting.
- **Refactoring**: ONLY change touched lines. Do NOT reformat unrelated code.
- **Testability**: Write code that can be tested. Inject dependencies, avoid static state.
